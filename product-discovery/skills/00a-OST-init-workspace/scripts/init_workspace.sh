Usage:
  Multi-product mode (default):
    init_workspace.sh --team <slug> --product <slug>
                      [--opportunity <slug>] [--selection]
                      [--date YYYY-MM-DD]

  Single-product mode:
    init_workspace.sh --single-product --product <slug>
                      [--opportunity <slug>] [--selection]
                      [--date YYYY-MM-DD]

Required:
  --product <slug>      Short lowercase ASCII slug (e.g. fsok, pmf-analyse)
  --team <slug>         Required unless --single-product. Short slug (e.g. fast).

Optional:
  --single-product      Drop the <team>/<product>/ nesting. Use when the repo
                        will only ever hold one product. Cannot combine with --team.
  --opportunity <slug>  Also scaffold opportunities/<slug>/ + a discovery round
                        folder dated today; set .current-scope to that round.
  --selection           Scaffold opportunity-selection/<today>/ and set
                        .current-scope there. Mutually exclusive with --opportunity.
  --date YYYY-MM-DD     Override today's date for the round folder name.

Run from the repo root where discovery/ should live.

<!-- Write the product outcome here.
     Format: a measurable customer-behavior change with a target value and time horizon.
     See product-discovery/knowledge/discovery/product-outcomes-i-olika-skeden.md
     for examples and the outcome-vs-business-outcome distinction.

     2. Run OST-setup-product and walk through the experience map
        interview. It writes experience-map-extracted.{md,json} into
        the active round folder.

     Both paths write to the round folder, not this file. Downstream

# Opportunity-selection round (phase A)

This dated folder collects the artifacts from one run of the
opportunity-selection workflow: extract candidates from interviews,
validate them against the citation format, compare against the product
outcome, and produce a proposal for one opportunity to ratify.

Each dated subfolder under `opportunity-selection/` is a separate run.
Re-run when you have new interview material or want to compare a fresh
set of candidates against the same outcome.

## Files that will land here (produced by the OST-* skills in order)

- `opportunities-extracted.{md,json}` — raw opportunity citations extracted from interview transcripts (OST-opportunity-extractor).
- `experience-map-extracted.{md,json}` — structured experience map, from a screenshot via OST-extract-experience-map or from the OST-setup-product interview.
- `experience-map-clustered.{md,json}` — opportunities clustered onto the journey phases (OST-cluster-opportunities).
- `opportunities-validated.md` — trio's verdict per opportunity: approved / needs tweak / solution in disguise (OST-validate-opportunities).
- `comparison-matrix.{md,json}` — qualitative matrix of approved opportunities × Torres criteria (OST-compare-opportunities).
- `chosen-opportunity-proposal.{md,json}` — AI's proposal of one opportunity to ratify, with rationale and alternatives considered (OST-select-opportunity).

After the trio ratifies a proposal, copy/refine it into
`../../opportunities/<opp-slug>/chosen-opportunity.md` (or re-run
`OST-init-workspace --opportunity <slug>` to scaffold that folder).

# Discovery round (phase B)

This dated folder collects the artifacts from one run of the
solution-discovery workflow for the chosen opportunity in the parent
folder. Brainstorm divergent solutions, cluster, pick top three,
surface assumptions, and design validation experiments.

Each dated subfolder is a separate run. Re-run when you want to
brainstorm again with new constraints or after experiments invalidate
earlier assumptions.

## Files that will land here (produced by the OST-* skills in order)

- `solution-candidates.{md,json}` — 18 divergent solution candidates from three role-diverse sub-agents (OST-brainstorm-solutions).
- `clustered-solutions.{md,json}` — candidates collapsed into 3-5 thematic clusters (OST-cluster-solutions).
- `top-three-solutions.{md,json}` — three solutions picked to carry into assumption testing (OST-select-top-three-solutions).
- `assumptions.{md,json}` — assumptions that must hold for each of the three solutions to move the product outcome (OST-generate-assumptions).
- `assumptions-categorized.{md,json}` — assumptions tagged into Cagan's five product-risk categories (OST-assumption-categorizer).
- `riskiest-assumptions.{md,json}` — assumptions where importance is high AND evidence is weak (OST-riskiest-assumptions).
- `validation-experiments.{md,json}` — Bland Test Cards for each riskiest assumption (OST-validation-experiment-designer).

The parent folder `../chosen-opportunity.md` holds the persistent context
for this opportunity. The parent's `../ratifications.md` is an optional
trio log of decisions made.

# ----- discovery README (formerly workspace README) -----
DISCOVERY_README=$(cat <<'EOF'
# Discovery workspace

This directory holds artifacts produced by the `product-discovery` plugin's
OST-* skills. Layout and conventions are shared across all skills — do
not move files around without checking the workspace-scope spec.

## Layout modes

Two modes are supported. Both use the same relative-path math, so the
phase skills do not care which mode the repo uses.

### Multi-product

For organisations with multiple teams or products in one repo:

```text
discovery/
├── .current-scope                                # one-line file: relative path to the active round folder
├── <team>/                                       # e.g. fast, norrsken
│   ├── _team-context/                            # team-level docs (optional)
│   └── <product>/                                # e.g. fsok
│       ├── _product-context/                     # product-outcome.md, experience-map.{md,json}
│       ├── opportunity-selection/<YYYY-MM-DD>/   # phase A round
│       └── opportunities/<opp-slug>/             # ratified opportunity
│           ├── chosen-opportunity.md             # persistent context
│           ├── ratifications.md                  # optional trio log
│           └── <YYYY-MM-DD>/                     # phase B round
```

### Single-product

For small repos with exactly one product (no team/product nesting):

```text
discovery/
├── .current-scope
├── _product-context/                             # product-outcome.md, experience-map.{md,json}
├── opportunity-selection/<YYYY-MM-DD>/           # phase A round
└── opportunities/<opp-slug>/                     # ratified opportunity
    ├── chosen-opportunity.md
    ├── ratifications.md                          # optional
    └── <YYYY-MM-DD>/                             # phase B round
```

## Scope resolution

Every OST-* skill resolves its scope (the round folder it reads/writes
inside) in this order, taking the first that exists:

1. Explicit `scope=` argument passed by the user when invoking the skill.
2. `discovery/.current-scope` — one-line file with a relative path from
   the repo root to the active round folder.
3. Prompt the user, defaulting to the latest dated round under the most
   recently touched opportunity.

A scope is an **opportunity-selection round** if its path contains
`/opportunity-selection/`, otherwise a **discovery round** if it
contains `/opportunities/`.

## Adding a new opportunity or round

Re-run `OST-init-workspace` with the new `--opportunity <slug>` or
`--selection` flag. The script is idempotent: existing files are never
overwritten.

## Full spec

The canonical convention (filenames, slug rules, context walk-up rules,
both layout modes) lives in the plugin source at
`product-discovery/knowledge/discovery/workspace-scope.md`.
